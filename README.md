Make sure you have a webcam. It's also preferrable to do this in Chrome.

# FocalMancy

This Hack-sprint problem is relatively simple in concept. It's a game. That tracks your eye movements. Or tries to anyway (our Webgazer.js library is...spotty sometimes). 

The premise is, you're a god. A being in charge of a pocket-dimension. In much the same way that Schr√∂dinger theorized that some things must be perceived in order to exist, your task is to keep this infant dimension alive through your mere observation. Too much diverted attention, however, will cause the destruction of your charge and, of course, all living beings within. 

# Mechanics
A brief description of the tools used. This game is primarily run through vanilla Javascript. It incorporates a free eye-tracking library, called Webgazer.js, to give a rough estimate of the location you happen to be staring at (hopefully, the bright orb on the screen). We acknowledge performance issues. Apparently, Javascript is not intended for complex and repeated mathematical operations and our program does reflect that. 

# Instructions
The main thing is a WEBCAMERA of some kind. Webgazer.js also has problems running in any browser besides Chrome. Besides that, assuming we didn't goof, you should simply be able to access our program at the following url: https://npr95.pythonanywhere.com/ 

# Inspiration
This game was inspired through a study we once heard (https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/13/4780). Elementary school children were given a simple task: stare at an object on the wall for 1-3 minutes. They were then examined for increases in attention and concentration. While it didn't result in superhuman attention, there were significant statistical increases in attention as well as increases in their ability to filter stimuli which is just as important for sustained concentration bouts. Obviously, we changed things up a little bit. Frankly, it would have been boring to make a game where participants only looked at a solitary object, even if that would have corresponded closer with the study this derives inspiration from.
